        <p>Well, we're officially on board this “World Security Insight” platform.
            Had the team coordinate with the programmers today to get our section set up.
            It's a naive idea, this “transparency” project, but it provides the cover needed.
            The arrangement made by the PM is... distasteful.
            Having to use that as the password.
            A constant reminder of the leverage they hold.
            <br>
            The calls from Mr. Tenet has been frequent this week. Always encrypted, always untraceable back to official channels.
            Same old voices from '05, '08, '12... the ones who vanished.
            They bark orders like they're still running the show at Langley.
            And because of that history, because of Cameron, we have to comply.
            Build this interface, embed the protocols, prepare the ground for Subproject 68's revival.
            All under the guise of "sharing national security insights".
            It makes my stomach turn.
            We're doing their dirty work, and Canada will take the inevitable fall if this ever gets out.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="Header">May 15th, 2024; 16:30</h2>
        <p>Our technical team completed the initial 'alterations' to the CSIS page today, as per Tenet’s directive.
            Minor code injections, data packet routing... standard stuff, but the purpose is anything but.
            It's meant to create the initial handshake, the first subtle layer of the network they're building.
            One of the junior programmers here mentioned a strange, faint audio anomaly during testing, like a persistent beep tied to specific interactions.
            Dismissed it as a system glitch, but it’s probably intentional.
            Another one of “their” clever little fingerprints, perhaps a hidden signal or a data burst masked as noise.
            Let the website team chase ghosts; it keeps them distracted.
            <br>
            It infuriates me that we have to implement their twisted plans.
            They call the shots, provide the (laundered) funding, and we build the infrastructure on our platform, risking everything, while they remain comfortably retired or hidden, pulling strings from the shadows of 2000-2015.
            This arrangement is supposed to guarantee Canada's “security” by preventing the exposure of Cameron's activities here.
            A Faustian bargain.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="Header">May 20th, 2024; 9:15</h2>
        <p>Just reviewed the programmers' log from today.
            Apparently, the current CIA Director, William J. Burns contacted them to change the CIA section password to “Ultra”.
            Ultra.
            That's Petraeus doing.
            He must be trying to signal something, or perhaps he's still somehow involved with them, despite his impending departure.
            The programmers noted he sounded suspicious and that someone else might have been on the call.
            Classic Petraeus, always playing both sides, or perhaps now realizing the monster he helped wake up.
            <br>
            This confirms my suspicion that they have hooks deep inside the US system, likely through old contacts like Petraeus.
            It also means the incoming Director, John Ratcliffe (set to take office in January), is stepping into a hornet's nest.
            He won't have a clue what's really going on.
            Maybe Petraeus is trying to leave a breadcrumb trail for Ratcliffe, a way to subtly alert him without directly betraying them.
            Or maybe he's just covering his tracks. Either way, it puts the US side of this operation in a state of flux.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="Header">June 15th, 2024; 8:45</h2>
        <p>Tenet  is getting impatient.
            They want to accelerate the data collection protocols.
            More profiles, faster.
            The website is performing as a perfect passive collection tool – people willingly providing information under the guise of engaging with security insights.
            It’s disturbing how easy it is.
            We're pushing back where we can without raising suspicion, citing technical delays and user interface testing. Every delay is a small act of defiance, but it feels futile.
            The pressure from the PM is immense; he's terrified of the Cameron scandal breaking.
            We're trapped.
            I need to find a way to communicate with someone on the US side who isn't compromised by them.
            Someone like the incoming Director, Ratcliffe.
            But how do I reach out without they finding out?</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="Header">October 10th, 2024; 10:30</h2>
        <p>The pressure is escalating.
            Tenet and the others are demanding access to Phase Two capabilities.
            It's no longer just passive data collection.
            They want to start implementing subtle environmental triggers through the website interface – specific visual or auditory patterns designed to influence user mood and behavior.
            It's straight out of the original MKUltra playbook, just updated for the digital age.
            They call it “cognitive priming”.
            We've managed to stall, citing testing and integration issues, but they're running out of patience.
            <br>
            The threat of the Cameron material being leaked hangs heavier than ever.
            The PM is visibly stressed, his public appearances more strained.
            He's made it clear that protecting Canada from that historical fallout is his absolute priority, even if it means participating in this.
            He keeps saying, "Just play along, Daniel. Just until we find a way out."
            But I don't see a way out.
            Ratcliffe takes office in January.
            Will he be sharp enough to see through this elaborate charade?
            Or will he just accept the narrative we're forced to</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="Header">January 23rd, 2025; 9:00</h2>
        <p>Today's the day.
            Director John Ratcliffe officially steps into his role at the CIA.
            There's a planned introductory meeting with the Prime Minister later this afternoon.
            Tenet has been very explicit about the talking points: re-affirm the strong US-Canada security partnership, emphasize the “World Security Insight” project as a vital joint initiative, and, if the topic of past programs somehow comes up, confirm Canada's leading role in revitalizing aspects of Subproject 68 to counter modern threats.
            The PM is ready to deliver the performance of a lifetime.
            <br>
            I have to be there.
            To observe, to ensure the PM sticks to the script, and to gauge Ratcliffe's reaction.
            Will he buy it?
            Or will he see the flicker of unease in the PM's eyes, the careful choice of words?
            I wish I could signal to him, somehow.
            A subtle cough, a specific gesture... anything to say, “This is a lie. We are being forced.”
            But they’ll be watching, listening.
            The risk is too high.
            Just have to stand there, poker face on, and watch us dig our own grave.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="Header">January 23rd, 2025; 16:00</h2>
        <p>The meeting is over.
            The Prime Minister delivered “their” narrative about Canada proudly leading the charge on revitalizing Subproject 68.
            He followed “their” script, presenting Canada as the proactive innovator in this controversial area.
            <br>
            And Ratcliffe... he came prepared.
            He didn't seem to be looking for confirmation of if Canada was involved, but rather acting on a pre-existing conviction.
            He listened to the PM's presentation with a focused intensity.
            The moment of confrontation came as they concluded.
            As they shook hands, Ratcliffe leaned in slightly and, in a low voice I could just barely hear, said something that clearly rattled the PM.
            He didn't say “I know you're lying”.
            What he said, based on the PM's reaction and what I've pieced together, was closer to:
            "Prime Minister, I know about Subproject 68. And I know you're behind its return."
            <br>
            The effect was immediate and profound.
            The smile vanished, replaced by sheer panic.
            The PM, for a split second, looked like a deer in headlights.
            He recovered quickly, but the fear was undeniable.
            Ratcliffe believes the Prime Minister is the orchestrator.
            He has information, likely from Petraeus or another source, that points directly to the PM.
            <br>
            After Ratcliffe left, the PM wasn't surprised that Ratcliffe was aware of Subproject 68's return; he was terrified that Ratcliffe believed he was the mastermind.
            "He thinks I'm running it!" the PM exclaimed, his voice tight with panic.
            "He thinks Canada is the primary force!
            They told me this wouldn't happen!
            They said the cover would hold!"
            He's realizing the full extent of how they have used him and Canada as the perfect scapegoat.
            The fear of the Cameron scandal is immense, but the fear of being wrongly implicated as the primary architect of a revived MKUltra is just as paralyzing.
            <br>
            Just now, one of my analysts flagged an unusual outgoing communication – an encrypted email sent to Director Ratcliffe's secure address from a burner account with a Canadian domain.
            The content… it wasn't from me, or anyone in my trusted circle.
            It was a direct threat, warning him to back off, to stop looking into Canada's initiatives, or face consequences.
            This is them, reinforcing Ratcliffe's incorrect belief that Canada is the main culprit, and simultaneously trying to scare him off, all while hiding behind our borders.
            <br>
            This confirms the dangerous game being played.
            Ratcliffe believes Canada, specifically the PM, is the enemy.
            They're actively cultivating this misconception and using it as both a shield and a weapon.
            My options to reach Ratcliffe and explain the truth are dwindling rapidly.
            They're monitoring, they’re manipulating, and they’re perfectly content to let Canada take the fall.
