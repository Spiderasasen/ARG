      <p>Huge brainstorming session today for the 'World Security Insight' project!
          We want to create a truly open platform where citizens can understand how different countries handle security.
          Transparency is key.
          It's ambitious, but the team is really passionate about this.
          Think of it - real data, real insights, directly from the source!</p>

      <p>First calls with the CSIS and CIA tech liaisons.
          Interesting folks.
          The CSIS team seemed... overly specific about certain backend access permissions.
          Didn't quite understand why they needed control over how certain file types are handled, but hey, they're the clients, right?
          Just making notes.</p>

      <p>Things are getting weird.
          Director <span class="redacted">Daniel Rogers</span> from CSIS initiated some big alterations to their section of the site today.
          While monitoring the deployment, one of our senior guys, Alex, swore he heard faint beeping sounds – like Morse code – coming from the browser when the CSIS page finished loading after clicking on their logo.
          We’ve tried to replicate it, checked the audio files, checked the network traffic – nothing obvious.
          Alex is usually rock-solid, but he's pretty shaken up about it.
          "It's tied to the click," he insists.
          We need to figure out what that sound is and where it's originating.
      </p>

      <p>Had a strange call with Director Dpsspht Q. Ibyuz from the CIA today.
          He requested a password change for their admin account.
          Requested "Ultra".
          Just... "Ultra".
          Why that?
          Our standard generated passwords are way more secure.
          It sounded like someone else was on the line with him, muffled voices in the background.
          He seemed... pressured.
          Our programmers are getting annoyed – these odd requests and the recent CSIS weirdness are slowing down our actual work on improving the site interface.
          But seriously, "Ultra"?
          It just feels significant somehow.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="Header">May 25th, 2024</h2>
      <p>Okay, this isn't just weird anymore.
          While doing routine maintenance on the database, I found hidden tables associated with the CSIS and CIA sections.
          They're storing encrypted data that has nothing to do with national security insights.
          The file names are just random strings, but the access patterns are... not random.
          They seem to correspond with unusual spikes in activity right after those "clicks" on the CSIS page.
          This goes beyond adding their "thoughts".</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="Header">June 1st, 2024</h2>
      <p>Pulled some late nights digging into that encrypted data.
          Can't crack it yet, but the structure is unsettling.
          It looks less like intel reporting and more like... profiles?
          Or data points for tracking.
          And Alex is still hearing the Morse code.
          He recorded a snippet – it's a short loop, repeats after a few seconds.
          Says it sounds different depending on where on the CSIS page you click.
          We're starting to talk amongst ourselves.
          This isn't the transparent project we signed up for.</p>
