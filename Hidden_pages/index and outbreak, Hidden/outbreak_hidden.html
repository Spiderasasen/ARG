      <p>We made it possible for people to learn from our nation's security.
          It's very import for people to understand and learn how each nations tries their best to protect and help its people.</p>
      <h2 class="Header">May 5th, 2024</h2>
      <p>We asked these nations if they want access to our website.
          Like having their own webpage that allows them to have their own logs, if people want to learn about their nation's security, it's only fair if the nation's security also has the ability to log their thoughts whenever they want.</p>
      <h2 class="Header">May 10th, 2024</h2>
      <p>We got 2 nations that have accepted our request as having them for using the website as their own personal webpage.
          That is the CSIS and the CIA.
          I was not expecting to have a nation, let alone the CIA to agree with our project.
          What an honor.</p>
      <h2 class="Header">May 15th, 2024</h2>
      <p>As of May 15th, 2024, Director Khupls Yvnlyz, took the initiative to make the CSIS make some changes to the website.
          We allowed one of our senior programmerâ€™s to observe the alterations of the code and he noted that he heard some morse code coming from the CSIS webpage.
          We have no idea where the sound comes from but we know that they clicked somewhere on the website.
          Further notice might be needed to find where this sound comes from.</p>
      <h2 class="Header">May 20th, 2025</h2>
      <p>Director Dpsspht Q. Ibyuz sounded suspicious on call earlier today.
          Asking to change his password to Ultra?
          I mean I thought keeping the password as orien was good?
          But we grant his request.
          Even though on call it sounded like someone else was with him.
          I don't know if it 's more of an annoyance to our programmers, because they are trying to make this website better.</p>
