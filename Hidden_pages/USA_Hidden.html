    <p>As I settle into my new office, the weight of history presses down harder than ever.
        We had to tell the people that this experiment was finished in 1964.
        But those damned Canadians want to work on Subproject 68 again!
        Out of all the things they could have asked for, they want THIS?
        It’s absurd!
        Do they really want to go back to torturing more innocent people?!
        No, I can't let this happen.
        I need to find Mark and see if he knows about this.</p>

    <p>He knows, and quite frankly he’s the one behind the operations.
        I can't believe it.
        This man, the Prime Minister of Canada is behind everything.
        I need to stop him.
        No matter what happens to me.
        I need to stop him.</p>
