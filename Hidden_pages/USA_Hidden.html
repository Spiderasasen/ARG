    <p>As I sit in my car, preparing to enter the CIA headquarters for the first time as Director, I scan through my emails and messages on my phone.
        Among the usual mundane correspondence, one <a href="../Assets/Letter_Super_Tool_100.pdf" target="_blank" class="hidden">letter</a> catches my eye—it’s hand-delivered, and immediately ominous.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="Header">January 23, 2025; 11:25</h2>
    <p>As I settle into my new office, the weight of history presses down harder than ever.
        We had to tell the people that this experiment was finished in 1964.
        But those damned <span class="redacted">Canadians want to work on Subproject 68</span> again!
        Out of all the things they could have asked for, they want THIS?
        It’s absurd!
        Do they really want to go back to torturing more innocent people?!
        No, I can't let this happen.
        I need to find Mark and see if he knows about this.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="Header">January 23, 2025; 16:00</h2>
    <p>I finally confronted Mark.
        The look on his face says everything.
        “He knows,” he whispers, each word heavy with the burden of betrayal.
        “Frankly, he’s the one behind the operations—the Prime Minister of Canada himself.”
        My heart races; I can't believe it.
        Someone I trusted is orchestrating this.
        “I need to stop him,” I murmur, determination coursing through me.
        “No matter what happens to me, I have to end this.”</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="Header">January 23, 2025; 18:45</h2>
    <p>As I probe deeper, I receive a chilling call from a covert Canadian representative.
        “Keep digging, and you'll learn things you wish you hadn’t, Ratcliffe,” they warn.
        Fear grips me, but it only solidifies my resolve.
        A political storm brews, and I see the intricate web of deception slowly pulling tighter.</p>
