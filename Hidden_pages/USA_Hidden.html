    <p>We had too. We had to tell the people that this experiment was finished in 1964.
        But those fucking Canadians wanted to work on subproject 68 again.
        Out of all the things they could have asked for our help, THEY WANTED THIS! This is absurd.
        Out of everything, they want to go back and to torture more innocent people?!

        This man, the Prime Minister of Canada is behind everything.

        No matter what happens to me.
        I need to stop him.</p>
