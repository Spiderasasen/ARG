            <p class="Left">The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is Russia’s main civilian agency responsible for intelligence gathering and espionage beyond the country’s borders, having succeeded the First Chief Directorate of the former KGB in December 1991. Headquartered in Moscow’s Yasenevo District, the SVR’s director reports directly to the President of the Russian Federation. Unlike the domestic-focused Federal Security Service (FSB), the SVR handles operations and intelligence collection abroad, often cooperating with its military counterpart, the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), though the latter is known to have a much larger overseas network. The SVR is also authorized to negotiate intelligence-sharing agreements with foreign governments, particularly concerning counterterrorism, and supplies analyzed intelligence directly to the Russian president. Details regarding the identities of both its staff and agents are strictly protected as state secrets, reflecting the deeply secretive nature of the agency’s work.</p>
