            <p class="left">The Director General for External Security heads the DGSE, France’s foreign intelligence agency, which is the French counterpart to the UK’s MI6 and the American CIA. Tasked with safeguarding French national interests through intelligence gathering, paramilitary actions, counterintelligence, and even economic espionage, the DGSE operates under the Ministry of Armed Forces and works closely with its domestic sister agency, the DGSI. The service—founded in 1943 and currently based in Paris—enforces a strict code known as LEDA: loyalty, elevated standards, discretion, and adaptability. These guiding principles are vital for managing the agency’s often secretive operations at home and abroad, as well as for maintaining trust among agents and global partners. While the details of the Director General’s identity and daily work are highly classified, the position remains central to France’s national security apparatus and its posture on the international stage.</p>

            <p class="right">Nicolas Lerner, born in 1978, is the current Director General of External Security (DGSE), France’s chief foreign intelligence agency, a role he assumed on January 9th, 2024. A distinguished graduate of Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA), Lerner has built a career focused on public administration and security. He began at the General Secretariat of the Ministry of the Interior and quickly rose through key posts, including chief of staff to both the Prefect of Hérault and the Paris Police Commissioner, as well as sub-prefect of Béziers. Lerner's expertise further deepened through his role as security coordinator in South Corsica (2015–2017) and as Deputy Director of the Ministry of the Interior Cabinet, followed by a successful tenure as Director General of Internal Security (DGSI). Known for his deep experience in both domestic security and intelligence, Lerner now leads the DGSE in safeguarding France’s interests abroad, drawing on his rich background in law enforcement, administration, and interagency coordination.
