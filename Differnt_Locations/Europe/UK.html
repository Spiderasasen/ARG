      <p class="left">MI6, formally known as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), is the United Kingdom’s agency responsible for gathering foreign intelligence to protect the country's national security and economic interests. Operating primarily overseas, MI6 works to collect, analyze, and deliver intelligence on threats such as international terrorism, espionage, hostile state action, and cyberattacks. By providing crucial information to policymakers and collaborating with British and allied security partners, MI6 plays a pivotal role in countering both traditional and emerging global threats, ensuring the safety and prosperity of the UK on the international stage.</p>

      <p class="right">Sir Richard Moore KCMG is the current Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), having taken up the role in October 2020. Born in Libya in 1963 and raised in both Libya and Sri Lanka, Moore developed a passion for international affairs early in life. He studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford and went on to receive a Kennedy Scholarship at Harvard. After joining MI6 as an intelligence officer, Moore served in postings around the world—including Vietnam, Turkey, Pakistan, and Malaysia—before becoming British Ambassador to Turkey from 2014 to 2017. He later held senior roles such as Deputy National Security Advisor and Director-General, Political, at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Known for his modern approach—being the first MI6 chief to use social media—Moore has brought public attention to issues like climate-related intelligence and diversity within the service. He will be succeeded by Blaise Metreweli in October 2025.
