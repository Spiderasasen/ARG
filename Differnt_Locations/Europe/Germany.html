          <p>The Federal Intelligence Service (Bundesnachrichtendienst, BND) is Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, operating under the direct authority of the Chancellor’s Office and headquartered in central Berlin. Established during the Cold War in 1956 as the successor to the covert Gehlen Organization, the BND quickly became one of the world’s largest and most influential intelligence agencies, second only to the CIA at its peak. With a workforce of around 6,500 employees stationed at over 300 domestic and international locations, the BND serves as an early warning system for threats to German interests abroad. The agency specializes in wiretapping, electronic surveillance, and gathering both civil and military intelligence on issues ranging from terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to organized crime and information warfare. Closely cooperating with Germany’s domestic security services and military intelligence, the BND remains a central pillar in securing the nation’s security and strategic interests worldwide, with a longstanding focus on Russia, the Middle East, and global non-state threats.</p>
