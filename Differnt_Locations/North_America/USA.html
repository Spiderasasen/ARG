    <p class="todo">Im thinking of adding pictures of people here, (with the name of the person below).
    we can add have a statment from him
    the username is the person's name
    the password could be a classic, Put All String'S With Over Rised Direction, (password)
    or making all the capital letters in a sentance to be the password
    (you have no idea how diffcult to even make that fucked up word as the password)
    the person could be a reporter, a goverment agent, or a solder.</p>
