        <p id="summary">The world is being overpopulated, and we are not making enough food to feed everyone.
            Humans are going insane, to the point that they are killing anything that moves just to feed themselves.
            This turns kind people into ruthless killers.
            People with little to no food are now fighting just to survive for a small bite of food.
            The world has gone mad, and we need to help everyone so we can make more food to feed everyone.</p>

            <img src="https://www.appletoncreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CSR-Blog.jpg" alt="Someone helping others in a food drive" class="Right">
            <p>Our job is to help people, no matter how low our food supplies are.
                From helping the richest people in Dubai to the poorest people in Africa, we want to help as many as we can who don't have enough food for their survival.
                This world is dying, and we need to help out as many people as we can.
                Even if we are starving ourselves, we will help out as many people as we can.
                Because no matter what happens, mankind will survive, and we will be there to help heal the world, even if the world does not want to help others, we will.
