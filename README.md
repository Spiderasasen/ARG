# What the HTML Files Mean
Index.html: This is the main home page. I'm just too lazy to rename it
Locations.html: This is where all the areas that were  affected
Outbreak.html: this is where the beginning areas of the "outbreak" went out, how they are affected by it, and seeing how everyone is affected
Login.html: When the user enters the right username and password, it will take them to the real truth of this company

# What not to Touch
if the file has .css or .js #**DONT FUCKING TOUCH IT**
  that shit makes the website look nice and also function
dont delate <head> or <body> elements

# What you can touch
anything inside <title>Here</title>, <p>here</ p>, <h#>here</h#>
  These areas just affect the text that is in the paragraph
anything in < !-- here -->
  Because it just tells me what the code does
  If you want to add some comments, its what they are called, just add them in the html code

# how to view it
if you want to see the website, just download the file,
  it will be a zip file
unzip the file
click on index.html (this is the homepage)
and boom, you will see it
*I hope*

this is a fun project and im giving code to fucking retards, which is a horrbal idea.
