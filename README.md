# ARG
This is a game that and John will be making. It's an ARG

#**My Idea**
I want to make it where people are starving, and the only way people can eat is by killing themselves. 
The company, when the player enters the right username and password, is making people eat other people, in short, cannibalism
  This can make the company infect more and more people, and slowly kill off more and more people until the population is stabilized again
  *deadass just copying the Malthusian theory from my Geography class*

# John's Idea

# Which one are  we taking
fuck if I know

Index.html: This is the main home page. I'm just too lazy to rename it
Locations.html: This is where all the areas that were  affected
Outbreak.html: this is where the beginning areas of the "outbreak" went out, how they are affected by it, and seeing how everyone is affected
Login.html: When the user enters the right username and password, it will take them to the real truth of this company
