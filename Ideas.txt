Here we can add our ideas,

First, we need to fix the index.html and outbreak.html
  index.html
    This section can be used to talk about the organization's plan for documenting this info
  outbreak.html
    First things first, think of a different name for this 
      About Us? 
    Next, we can add more to the why in this section
      Why document all this info

Next, we can talk about the hidden pages
  I already made one
    This is where more redacted info will be located. 
      more puzzels to show the redacted
        Maybe different measures
      links to seeing wtf is going on and why they are doing this

style?
  This is more optional, but if you can look at the style and tell me if we should change the style or add more stuff
    different styles for a certain button, 
    different background color
    etc.
